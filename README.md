## About

This repo includes a patch for [minisat](https://github.com/niklasso/minisat) (at commit 37dc6c6) to enumerate all satisfying assignments for Alloy models.

Also included is a ruby script that downloads and runs the [Alloy models that have been converted to a SAT formula in CNF](http://projects.csail.mit.edu/mulsaw/alloy/sat03/index.html).
